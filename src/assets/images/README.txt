IMPORTANT: Default Avatar Image

Please place a default avatar image named "default-avatar.png" in this directory.
This image will be used as a fallback when a user doesn't have a profile picture.

The image should be:
- Named exactly "default-avatar.png"
- Sized approximately 200x200 pixels

You can use any generic avatar or silhouette image that's appropriate for your application.
